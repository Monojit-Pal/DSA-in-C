# DSA-in-C
This repository contains implementations of common data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, etc.) and algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.) in C. Designed for learning, practice, and reference, the code is clean, well-commented, and optimized for performance.
